# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ML
Machine Learning project to predict customer churn using classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) on telecom dataset.
Customer churn means when customers stop using a companyâ€™s service. Predicting churn is very important for telecom companies to reduce losses and improve customer retention.
This project builds a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on features like age, contract type, monthly charges, tenure, and more.
